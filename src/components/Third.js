          We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. We

          Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our

          achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly
          diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of
          perspectives. We donâ€™t always agree with each other, but opinion and
          debate are valued and openly encouraged.
